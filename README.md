# TS-Playground

this is a node.js playground project with preconfigured options to write typescript with persistent debugging.

---

start the project in dev mod
```shell
yarn dev
```


start the project in debug mode
```shell
yarn dev:debug
```
You can now use vscode debug configuration and debug your typescript code directly.
Debugging will stay persistant even when nodemon restarts.
